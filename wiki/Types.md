## Instrutions prefixes

Although not all instructions, most of them are prefixed by a letter that informes of the types used in the intructions.

These prefixes influence how operations are done (i.e.: signed or not) and the data type's size

| Prefix | Meaning   | Size    |
| ------ | --------- | ------- |
| a      | reference | 32 bits |
| b      | byte      |  8 bits |
| c      | char      | 16 bits |
| d      | double    | 64 bits |
| f      | float     | 32 bits |
| i      | int       | 32 bits |
| l      | long      | 64 bits |
| s      | short     | 16 bits |


## Function Symbols

These are used to indicate return types and parameter types:

| Prefix | Meaning   | Size    |
| ------ | --------- | ------- |
| a      | reference | 32 bits |
| B      | byte      |  8 bits |
| C      | char      | 16 bits |
| D      | double    | 64 bits |
| F      | float     | 32 bits |
| I      | int       | 32 bits |
| J      | long      | 64 bits |
| S      | short     | 16 bits |
| V      | void      | -       |
| Z      | boolean   | 32 bits |

### Boolean

Boolean related opertation are done using the int equivalent instruction.
Value 0 is false and value 1 is true.
